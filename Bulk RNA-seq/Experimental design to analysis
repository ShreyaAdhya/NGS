Bulk RNA-seq analysis does not begin at the computer—it begins at **experimental design**. 
Every decision made during sample planning, library preparation, and sequencing determines what can (and cannot) be inferred computationally. Good bioinformatics cannot rescue poor design, but good design enables robust, interpretable analysis.

## 1. Experimental Design: the foundation of valid analysis

### Biological replicates

Biological replicates capture **natural biological variability** and are essential for estimating variance. In bulk RNA-seq, **a minimum of three biological replicates per condition** is required to perform statistically valid differential expression (DE) analysis. With fewer replicates, dispersion cannot be estimated reliably, leading to unstable or meaningless p-values.

**Bioinformatics impact**

* Determines statistical power
* Enables valid DE modeling (e.g. DESeq2, edgeR)
* Insufficient replicates → exploratory results only

---

### Case–control vs time-series designs

A **case–control** design compares discrete conditions (e.g. disease vs control), while a **time-series** design models expression changes across multiple time points. These designs require different statistical models and assumptions.

**Bioinformatics impact**

* Case–control: `~ condition`
* Time-series: `~ time` or `~ subject + time`
* Wrong model choice → incorrect conclusions

---

### Batch design and randomization

A **batch** is a group of samples processed under the same technical conditions (same day, kit, lane, operator). Batch effects are unavoidable, but **confounding is avoidable**.

**Good design** randomizes all conditions across batches.
**Bad design** processes one condition per batch.

**Bioinformatics impact**

* Balanced batches → modelable (`~ batch + condition`)
* Batch = condition → no valid DE possible
* Batch effects dominate PCA if not handled correctly

## 2. RNA selection strategy: what transcriptome you see

### Poly(A) selection

Enriches polyadenylated mRNA, producing a **clean, protein-coding-focused dataset**. Requires good RNA quality.

### rRNA depletion

Removes ribosomal RNA while retaining **coding and non-coding RNAs**, and works well for degraded or FFPE samples.

**Bioinformatics impact**

* Poly(A): mostly exonic reads, simpler DE
* rRNA depletion: more intronic/intergenic reads, larger testing burden
* Annotation choice and QC expectations differ

---

## 3. Library properties: structure matters

### Strandedness

Strandedness indicates whether reads retain information about the **DNA strand of origin**. This is critical for accurate read assignment in overlapping or antisense genes.
[And, strandedness has no relation with paired and unpaired reads, strandedness - direction information of read]

**Bioinformatics impact**

* Correct strandedness → accurate gene counts
* Wrong strandedness → silent misassignment and false DE

---

### Paired-end vs single-end sequencing

Paired-end sequencing reads both ends of a fragment, improving mapping accuracy and splice detection. Strandedness and paired-end sequencing are **independent properties**.

**Bioinformatics impact**

* Paired-end improves alignment and isoform resolution
* Does not determine strand information by itself

---

### Libraries and multiplexing

A **library** is the sequence-ready representation of a sample, containing adapters and barcodes. **Multiplexing** allows many libraries to be sequenced together using unique indexes.

**Bioinformatics impact**

* Enables cost-effective sequencing
* Introduces risks such as adapter contamination and index hopping
* Requires careful QC and trimming

---

## 4. Sequencing depth and platform choice

### Sequencing depth

Sequencing depth is the **number of reads per sample**. For bulk RNA-seq:

* ~20–30M reads: standard gene-level DE
* Higher depth: improved detection of low-expression genes

**Bioinformatics impact**

* Low depth → noisy PCA, false negatives
* Uneven depth → biased variance estimation
* More replicates at moderate depth > fewer samples at very high depth

---

### Sequencing platforms

Illumina platforms (NovaSeq, NextSeq, HiSeq) dominate bulk RNA-seq due to accuracy and throughput. High-throughput platforms lower cost per sample but increase technical complexity (e.g. index hopping).

**Bioinformatics impact**

* Platform influences error profiles and QC expectations
* Legacy datasets (older platforms, unstranded, shorter reads) require special care

---

## 5. Controls and spike-ins

Spike-ins are synthetic RNAs of known concentration added before library prep. They help assess **technical variation**, not biological variability.

**Bioinformatics impact**

* Useful for QC and special normalization cases
* Do not replace biological replicates
* Typically excluded from DE testing

---

## 6. What bioinformaticians must always know before analysis

Before starting we should know:

* Number of biological replicates
* Batch structure and randomization
* RNA selection method
* Strandedness and read layout
* Sequencing depth and platform
* Whether spike-ins were used

These parameters will directly define:

* QC expectations
* Alignment and counting settings
* Statistical model design
* Interpretation limits
